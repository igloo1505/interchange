It’s just a little bit of your week. It’s nice to get out and meet new people. If we did a little more helping regularly, I think we’d have a better society.”</p></blockquote><p style="text-align: start"><span style="color: rgb(112, 112, 112)">Do you or your organization have a group of volunteers interested in helping out at the pantry?

Luckily Interchange popped up, and I live pretty close by, so I just signed up and started coming to volunteer.”</p><p style="text-align: start">In addition to volunteering at the pantry, Hannah works in real estate and for fun enjoys running with the Milwaukee Running Group. She says she really enjoys running by the lake. While she stays busy, she’s glad she has time to volunteer regularly too.</p><p style="text-align: start">“Recently I’ve been the name taker, helping with operations and welcoming guests to the pantry,” she said. “That’s fun because I get to be social and interact. Everyone’s always really high energy, so I love taking names.”</p><p style="text-align: start">“I also like to organize things, so all the prep work before we open, like getting bags together, is usually really satisfying too. I enjoy that too,” she added.</p><p style="text-align: start">We asked Hannah what she’d say to someone who is interested in volunteering but hasn’t come in yet.</p><p style="text-align: start">“I would say, definitely come in and just try it. When you’re taking the time to give back to your community, it helps everybody else, and it helps you, it’s a good way to get out of the house and just do something. And, I know we always need volunteers,” Hannah said.</p><p style="text-align: start">We couldn’t have said it better ourselves.
